A simple API wrapper library for accessing the [https://shortcut.io/](https://shortcut.io/) API. 

By default, the package returns queries from the V2 API - full documentation can be found here [https://api.shortcut.io/api/v2](https://api.shortcut.io/api/v2). 

## Installing

<!-- If you're putting `shortcutr` on CRAN, it can be installed with

    install.packages("shortcutr") -->

The pre-release version of the package can be pulled from GitHub using the [devtools](https://github.com/r-lib/devtools) package:

    # install.packages("devtools")
    devtools::install_github("SymbolixAU/shortcutr")

## What else do I need?

You need an access token to retrieve and put records into shortcut. 

If you / your team has a shortcut account, bring up the Settings menu (top right) and select "API tokens" from the list on the left.  

!["api token"](man/figures/shortcut_api_token.png)

Download and save it somewhere safe.  I recommend adding it to your .Rprofile and retrieving it with `Sys.getenv("CH_TOKEN")`

If your team doesn't use shortcut.....I can't help you.  If you are an agile team it's worth a look - it's more structured than Trello and much more user friendly than Jira.  And, no they haven't given me any money (though, if someone is offering....)

## Setting up

### Telling `shortcutr` about your API token

You can send your token as an argument to the API functions. 
If you are a little ~~lazy~~ efficient you can also use one of the package's convenience functions to set it once for all subsequent API calls to use.

To set: 

```{r, eval = FALSE}

set_token("mysecrettoken")

```

To retrieve your token (if needed):

```{r, eval=FALSE}

get_token()

```

### Changing the API version

By default, the package returns queries from the V2 API but you can override this on a function-by-function basis by setting the `url` parameter.  You can also change the default.  For example, if you want to be brave and use the latest, beta version you would:

```{r, eval=FALSE}

set_url(url = "https://shortcut.io/api/beta")

```

### Reset defaults

To reset the API settings to their defaults (i.e. clear the stored token and reset to V2 of the API), simply:

```{r, eval=FALSE}

reset_api()

```

---

## 'GET'ting records

You can list all the records for a single API endpoint (`ch_list_all`), or you can retrieve a single record (`ch_get_one`).

### `ch_list_all`

You can list all records from the following endpoints


>> "categories", "epic-workflow", "epics", "files", "labels", "linked-files", "members",
  "milestones", "projects", "repositories", "stories","teams", "workflows"


You can pull back all the details:

```{r, eval=TRUE}
library(shortcutr)

set_token("foo")

ch_list_all(endpoint = "categories",response_type = "full")

```

Or just a minimal set (useful if you just want to filter and get an `id` or two so you can retrieve just those records).

```{r, eval=TRUE}

ch_list_all(endpoint = "categories",response_type = "minimal")

```

### Return one record

If you know the `id` of the record you want to retrieve you can get that record.  If I want to get the full information about the Story with `id` 123, it's as simple as:

```{r}
# This returns a list object with all the story details
res <- ch_get_one(id = 123L, endpoint = "stories")

# From here you can access the tasks on the Story card
res$tasks

# Or the point estimate
res$estimate

# or the description
res$description

#....you get the idea

```


## Next tasks

Currently the package only contains GET functions.  The next step is to add in the ability to create, update and delete records.  I'll track progress in the Issues tab.
